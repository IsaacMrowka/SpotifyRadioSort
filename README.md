This website runs on flask and react and is powered by render.com. The goal of the website is to allow spotify users to choose a specific song and have spotify's "song radio" feature return playlists that are either only from there own liked songs or are brand new to the user, unlike Spotify's song radio feature which will give a single playlists with liked and unliked songs mixed.

**only users that have given me their email can access the website**,
spotify will not allow users who have not been onboarded through the spotify api by giving me their email.
